# AutoGrow

AutoGrow is an IoT/ML based system which can revolutionize Agriculture sector by automating Greenhouses by supplying optimal amount of Water, Nutrients and Acid based on the state of the system which includes various additional parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Plant growth index, etc along with N-P-K Levels and pH. AutoGrow is being developed with a focus on minimizing costs, ensuring it is particularly well-suited for the Indian agricultural system. The training system leverages Reinforcement Learning to develop an automated control policy. 

I have been training models with various parameters and fine-tuning them based on the evaluation of each model's performance. 

Here, I have uploaded a few of those files.  Autogrow3.ipynb is the latest model trained.
